    <h1>Top 10 ways to save money</h1>
    <p>
    <ol> 1-Spend less than you make.</ol>
    <ol> 2- Create a budget.</ol>
    <ol>3- Create a long-range budget for a year or more, one for the school term, and a short-term
        budget for each month.</ol>
    <ol>4- Keep receipts, bills, cancelled checks, and credit card statements in a jar or box in case
        you want to exchange your purchase and to help you put together an accurate bugdet.</ol>
    <ol> 5- File all of your receipts. Be realistic and monitor your budget each month. Refine it, and
        then stick to it.</ol>
    <ol>6- Credit cards are convenient and a way to establish a good credit rating. If you have one use
        it only for emergencies or special items like airline tickets. Pay off the balance on a credit
        card immediately. Interest charges are expensive. You will be tempted to buy more with credit,
        and it is difficult to monitor how much you spend. Make certain you have the money to pay for
        the items that you charge.</ol>
    <ol>7- Resist wasteful habits.</ol>
    <ol>8- Brew your own coffee and pack a snack instead of buying a latte and a roll every morning.
        You'll save about $25 a week.
        Buy a water filter and fill a water jar instead of buying bottled water.</ol>

    <ol>9- set a goal. Start by thinking of what you might want to save for—perhaps you’re getting married,
        planning a vacation or saving for retirement. Then figure out how much money you’ll need and how long it
        might take you to save it</ol>
    <ol>10- Don't smoke, and save thousands of dollars a year.</ol>

    <h1>Why Saving Money is Important</h1>
    <p>

        <br>
        Peace of Mind
        Who hasn’t lain awake at 3:00 a.m. wondering how they were going to afford something they needed? If
        money is really tight, you might be wondering how you’re going to pay the rent next week. If you’re a
        little further up the financial ladder, you might be worried about how many months you could pay the
        bills if you lost your job. Later in life, the money thoughts that keep you up at night might center
        around paying for your kids to go to college or having enough money to retire.
        <br>
        <br>
        As you accumulate savings, your financial worries should diminish, as long as you’re living within your
        means. If you already have next month’s rent taken care of by the first week of the current month, if
        you know you can get by without work for three to six months, if you have savings accounts for your
        children’s education and your own retirement that you’re regularly funding, you’ll sleep better at
        night. The reduced stress from having money in the bank frees up your energy for more enjoyable thoughts
        and activities. Finding the best savings account is key to making sure that the money that you do put
        away earns you the highest interest.
        <br>
        <br>
        Expanded Options
        The more money you have saved, the more you control your own destiny. If your job has you on the verge
        of a nervous breakdown, you can quit, even if you don’t have a new job lined up yet, and take time off
        to restore your sanity before you look for new employment. If you’re tired of living in an unsafe
        neighborhood, you can move to a safer area because you’ll have enough for a deposit on a better
        apartment or a down payment on a nicer home.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you get sick and need expensive healthcare that your insurance doesn’t cover, you’ll have a way to
        pay for it even though you can’t work while you’re getting treatment. And knowing that you have options
        because of the money you’ve socked away can give you even more peace of mind.
        <br>
        <br>
        No, money doesn’t solve every problem. If you are laid off, it might take as long as two years to find a
        new job. Some illnesses won’t go away no matter how many procedures you can afford, and random crime can
        happen even in a supposedly secure gated community. But with more money in the bank to deal with issues
        like these, you give yourself better odds of coming out on top.
        <br>
        <br>

        If you have a high income and low expenses, you might accumulate enough to retire in 10 years. For most
        people, it takes closer to 40 years. But at some point, if you save and invest regularly, you should be
        able to live off the income generated by your investments—the saved money that’s working for you. The
        earlier you start, the more time a small amount of money has to grow large through the miracle of
        compounding.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Bottom Line
        Saving money is incredibly important. It gives you peace of mind, expands your options for decisions
        that have a major effect on your quality of life, and eventually gives you the option to retire. Most
        people who are wealthy got there through a combination of their own hard work and smart savings and
        investment decisions. You can become one of those people, too.
